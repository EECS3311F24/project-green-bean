In review of sprint 2, we as a group looked at what we couldâ€™ve done better and what we improved on since the last sprint and how we can look at this sprint in helping us going forward. The biggest jump we took from the last sprint was our communication before as a group we had no communication on what was being done or what was in progress causing us to be very late on our deadlines, this sprint we worked on that and made communication a key focus and this let us meet our deadlines for all our functionalities and giving us a couple days to sit down before the sprint ended to look at our next functionality deadlines. But some bad practices we made was our assignment of work even though we picked up our slacking in this area and payed more attention to the trello we still had a lot of confusion at the start of the sprint but by the end as a group we believed we had done a good job in staying a top of the work assigned individually and communicating issues and problems we were facing. Overall, this sprint was a big step up from sprint 1 and the issues we had there and hopefully we can continue these good practices in sprint 3 but be more realistic with what we can get done in the amount of time provided.
