SNovember 3rd, 2024 SR1 meeting
In the meeting we discussed the unfished user stories and task and the very underwhelming amount of work that was left uncompleted in sprint 1 due to us realizing late into the development of our backend and frontend that we should mvoe away from using HTML,CSS, and javascript but it would be more appropiate to use react to implement our user stories and design, we further discussed the need for more frequent and open line of communication between the team and assigned work for future sprints such as sprint 2 need to be started much sooner, we discussed and planned the next meetings we would need to have to get back on track for the next sprint 2 deadline. We discussed how we left to much work to the end of the sprint goal causing us to realize our mistakes too late, the meeting ended with acknowledge of the work needing to be done quicker.
