Standups Sprint 1:

October 31st, 2024 - Sprint #1 Standup #1

The first Standup as a group we focused on the implementation of the backend and frontend capabilities with some API functions and working on the system design. We are looking to start the implementation of the frontend and connecting it to the backend, this should take us up close to the deadline so about 2-3 days, there is some implementation that still needs to be tested and corrected but we have some backlog on the implementation due to the lack of knowledge and research with Firebase.

November 3rd, 2024 - Sprint #1 Standup #2

Since the first standup, we started on the frontend but nothing was pushed for that yet as we had to go back and fix up the implementation of the backend and updated some APIâ€™s for the booking implementation and overall restructuring the backend along with the database and how we are keeping track of bookings for now until we have a more detailed front end which is what we are looking to commit to working on next which should be done in a 1 day, but for this standup we had no blockers besides not having a committed front end to work and communicate the backend from.


November 4th, 2024 - Sprint #1 Standup #3

During this standup, we had working implementation of the front end but as we created the front we realized that we would have a easier time with using react to code up the front and connect it to our database, so our next commitment was to transfer our work to react for future implementations as well, this work has already changed from the previous implementation of HTML/CSS to the implemented react.js, group just finished up the sprint with the documentation to end off the sprint 1 and are looking to continuing adding onto this by next starting the fixes for searching/filtering.
