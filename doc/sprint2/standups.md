All team members were present for the virtual meeting, since the last standup everyone has contributed different components for the project, Vish since the last standup had been working on fixing and updating the search feature within the application. As well as moving most of the old code from html/css to react.js. And now Vish is committed to working on getting the user authentication up and running including sign in and sign up for guest users and the timeline for this is between Nov 14. Orrin since the last standup has been working on the system design document and some of the api routing and testing for the backend, and the next commit for him will be to get reviews and rating page up and running with the backend and the timeline for this is between Nov 14. As for Prabhjot since the last commit has been working on the documentation between sprint 1 and sprint 2, and from here the next commits that need to be worked on is creating the front end pages for both Orinn and Vish for the reviews, ratings, and user authentication and has the deadline for Nov 14-16, and Mark has been working on the front end and helping Vish in meetings to move from the old code to react.js and is now looking to commit the front end pages for filtering and has a deadline of up to Nov 17. Since the previous standup session, Brian is now committed ot working on the filter options menu overlay and functionality for select sport-type, ratings, price range and private/public type filter using react redux with Mark. The commit for the filter frontend  should be completed by Nov 16th. For everyone the blocker for getting everything to the expected deadlines is to have a better grasp of React and its libraries and frameworks. That is all that has been done up to this point in time of the standup as it is the beginning of sprint 2 we are adjusting our plan on how to focus our time and effort compared to how we did in sprint 1.
