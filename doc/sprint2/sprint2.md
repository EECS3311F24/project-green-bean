The sprint goal for sprint 2 is to have the majority of the main components of our release goal functional for user use, such as mentioned in the release goal was filtering, Feedback/ratings, and user login and guest sign up for booking and email confirmation notifications. Using spike we can be more efficient with our implementation of these functionalities in a timely manner. 

Purpose of Spike

To have the fastest and most efficient implementation of our key goals for the sprint goal.
The spike will look at key challenges and technical requirements such as frameworks and libraries associated with completing the key functionalities for sprint 2 and thus giving us a clear roadmap for implementing these features and to also ensure they align with our sprint and release goals:

Filtering: Allow users to filter results based on specific criteria.
Feedback/Ratings: Enable users to provide feedback and ratings on items or services.
User Login and Guest Sign-Up for Booking: Facilitate secure user login, guest booking, and session management.
Email Confirmation Notification: Allows the user to have the info of the booking easier to access via their email and confirmation of the users booking to have gone through.

Approach

Filtering: Research available frameworks or APIs ( ElasticSearch for bigger datasets or in-house filtering logic).
Feedback/Ratings: Explore data models for storing and retrieving feedback and rating data. Prototype a feedback submission form integrated with backend storage. Research aggregation logic for average ratings and user insights.
User Login and Guest Sign-Up: Review authentication frameworks (OAuth, Firebase Authentication). Prototype a basic login/sign-up and guest booking flow.



Timeline

The timeline for the implementation of the functionalities should all be completed within the given time period of November 10th - November 16th and will be reviewed during daily stand ups throughout the week to track progress and completion of tasks.
