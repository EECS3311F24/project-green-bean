In a retrospective of the last sprint; sprint 1 we as a group sat down and discussed the good and bad practices we made in sprint 1. To start off with the bad practices we had during sprint 1 mostly being time management, throughout the first sprint we did not manage our time together as a group which goes hand in hand with another major issue we had in communication. Due to the lack of communication within the group no one was sure what they were working on and thus many mistakes were made and not all the deliverables we wanted to be done were done on time and this caused us to rush to complete and even causing us to need an extension to our sprint 1 deadline delaying our start to sprint 2. Some of the good practices we made during sprint 1 was the way we went about breaking down tasks and researching and helping each other out when members of the team did not understand certain material. Overall, we made a lot of mistakes in the way we approached the project in sprint 1 and are taking this into account when moving on to the next sprint to meet our release goal and deadlines for the next 2 sprints.
