York Recreation App

CatchCorner and the York Recreation App are the main competitors with this app. Though the Green Bean app is more versatile when it
comes to variety.

The purpose of the Green Bean web application is to provide a sport booking and events service that would help provide clear information on venues such as hockey rinks, and other sports recreation centers that would allow athletes, coaches, and others to much more easily filter and search and rent arenas around the GTA based on their needs and the ratings of community provided feedback based on user experience. Allowing it to be much more orientated to each individual's needs.

While CatchCorner does have similar objectives as our app, our focus is to bring a more connected community among all athletes, 
professional coaches and organizers. It will emphasize on having the best options for either public or private courts/facilities 
based on community feedback to ensure full satisfaction for users.

CatchCorner only displays arenas with information and rental costs, but does not provide any user feedback about each arena, 
making it vague for users to decide if it is worth to check the location out. Our app will provide more insight on the arenas to ensure 
users the quality of it.

Our app has an option to display public areas like outdoor tennis courts, rinks, basketball courts, and others as well.  
They do not require any payment since it is public, but it is another way to help athletes and coaches find those types of locations if 
they do not want to rent. Public locations will have their own community feedback as well so it can let users know the quality 
of these courts.

Planning events is another vital feature for planners. CatchCorner only gives an option for users to rent a facility but not much options are there when planning events, which will cause some disarray between the players, coaches, and the others. Our app will allow organizers to have full control of the available facilities by having organized games for athletes and coaches. That way these events will be more organized and less stressful for the players.

The York Recreation App is solely focused on one place. It does have a variety of features showcasing drop-in times, events, 
and upcoming leagues, but our app will be meant to be used for the general public instead of YorkU students.
