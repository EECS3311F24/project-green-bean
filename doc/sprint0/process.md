# Process

## How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
The approach our team, Green Bean, took when working on Sprint 0 for our project started out very messy, but with time we were able to split the work and organize the project. In order to do this, we looked at what each team member had a better understanding of and what was expected from the group. To ensure that no one was oblivious to other parts of the project, we had conversations in our weekly team meetings about how each of us approached our work. The tools we used during this phase included Google Docs to keep all our work present, GitHub to push the final versions of our work, Discord for communication, and VS Code for creating and connecting the project skeleton.

## How did you make decisions?
Decisions were made collectively during group meetings. Nothing was final until the group agreed by majority that it was the right direction to take.

## How frequently did you meet?
We met on average 3-4 times a week to ensure everyone understood the work assigned and to make sure we could meet deadlines. If help was needed on specific tasks or if group discussions were required, the team would meet as necessary.

## How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
Initially, our team brainstormed ideas for user stories that aligned with our developed personas and user interface, while considering the impact of each story on the usability and user experience of our web app. We defined the priority of each user story based on its complexity and scope, using a priority scale ranging from 1-5. After group deliberation, we eventually reached a consensus on the priority estimation for each user story.

## What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
As a group, we discussed and agreed that in the next phase of the project, we need to address issues more quickly to save time. One of our biggest takeaways from this phase is the need to use the allotted time for deadlines more effectively, rather than rushing in a shorter, more hectic timeline. We plan to improve this by using Trello in the next phase to better manage our tasks and deadlines.
